                <p class="bread">I am curious and analytic person who will take on any challenge in front of me with
                    a drive to develop, learn and innovate that borders on obsession. I was most recently
                    in a dual role combining Print Coordination and Project Management at IKEA
                    of Sweden. I am at my best when I have a difficult task to accomplish. I am driven,
                    smart, technical and ridiculously persistent. I learn fast and enjoy working to gather
                    information and develop rather than being too specifically instructed – what I
                    don´t know I can find out and what skills I lack I can acquire, that is my attitude and
                    it´s what I most enjoy doing. Doing it together with a team is even better!</p>

                <h2 class="whiteItem2">The future</h2>
                <p class="bread">As of right now, I´m back in school. This is something I have wanted to do for
                    a long time, and I have finally started on the path to become a JAVA-developer.
